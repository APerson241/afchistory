# afchistory
A Wikipedia tool for displaying a user's history of [Articles for Creation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation) reviews.

I'll be hosting it soon; in the meantime, you can download it, run the app with `python afchistory.py`, and navigate to `localhost:5000`.
